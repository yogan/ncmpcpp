.SH "CONFIGURATION"
When ncmpcpp starts, it tries to read user's settings from the ~/.ncmpcpp/config file. If no user's configuration is found, ncmpcpp uses its default configuration. An example configuration file containing all default values is provided with ncmpcpp and can be found usually in /usr/share/doc/ncmpcpp (exact location may depend on used distribution/OS/configure prefix).

Note: Each config option value must be enclosed in quotation marks (var = "example"). If you want to use quotation mark inside config option, prepend character '\\' to it.

Note: COLOR has to be the name (not a number) of one of colors 1-8 from SONG FORMAT section.

Supported configuration options:
.TP 
.B mpd_host = HOST
Connect to MPD running on specified host/unix socket.
.TP

.SH "KEYS"
When ncmpcpp starts, it tries to read user's keybindings from ~/.ncmpcpp/keys file. If no user's keybindings is found, ncmpcpp uses its default keybindings. An example keybindings file containing all default values is provided with ncmpcpp and can be found usually in /usr/share/doc/ncmpcpp (exact location may depend on used distribution/OS/configure prefix).

You can view current ncmpcpp's keybindings by pressing '1' (Help).
.SH "SONG FORMAT"

For song format you can use:

 %l - length
 %f - filename
 %D - directory
 %a - artist
 %A - album artist
 %t - title
 %b - album
 %y - year
 %n - track number (01/12 -> 01)
 %N - full track info (01/12 -> 01/12)
 %g - genre
 %c - composer
 %p - performer
 %d - disc
 %C - comment
 $R - begin right alignment

You can also put them in { } and then they will be displayed only if all requested values are available and/or define alternate value with { }|{ } e.g. {%a - %t}|{%f} will check if artist and title tags are available and if they are, display them. Otherwise it'll display filename.

\fBNote\fR: Format that is similar to "%a - %t" (i.e. without any additional braces) is equal to "{%a - %t}", so if one of the tags is missing, you'll get nothing.

Text can have different color than the main window, e.g. if you want length to be green, write $3%l$9.

Available values for colors:

 - 0 - default window color (discards all other colors)
 - 1 - black
 - 2 - red
 - 3 - green
 - 4 - yellow
 - 5 - blue
 - 6 - magenta
 - 7 - cyan
 - 8 - white
 - 9 - end of current color

\fBNote\fR: colors can be nested, so if you write $2some$5text$9, it'll disable only usage of blue color and make red the current one.

.SH "BUGS"
Report bugs on http://www.musicpd.org/mantis/
.SH "NOTE"
Since MPD uses UTF\-8, ncmpcpp needs to convert characters to the charset used by the local system. If you get character conversion errors while you are running ncmpcpp, you probably need to set up your locale. This is done by setting LANG and LC_ALL/LC_CTYPE environment variables (LC_CTYPE only affects character handling).
